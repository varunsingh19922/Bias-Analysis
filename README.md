This is a Machine/Deep Learning project, where I compare different modeling techniques on popular word embeddings like GloVe, ConceptNet Numberbatch and twitter GloVe. This project is based on work done by Dr Robyn Speer. She helped mitigate bias by creating a new word embedding. I want to use more sophisticated models to be able to further improve the model. 
In this project I use an SGD classifier(same as Dr. Robyn), a feed forward neural network and BERT(Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) for the task of sentiment analysis.
